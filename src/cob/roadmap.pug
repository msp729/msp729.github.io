        p The overall plan is to define how the language should behave, syntax included, first.
        p Next, I'll begin working on the compiler- lexer, parser, and translator being the components of a GCC frontend.
        p Then, I'll make a standard library for Cob. It'll include FS access, collections, numeric classes, etc.
        p At that point, I'll finally be semi-done with Cob, and I'll begin iterating.
        br
        p I'll look for flaws in the specification, make a new version of the language, rinse and repeat.
