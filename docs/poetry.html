airpods in my ears
i press on them to
try to get them to
fit just right, so
that i wont hear a
thing.

but i hear them, &
they're talking, &
i can't fucking read.

his elbow is on my
desk and i know it
doesn't matter and
if i asked him, he
would move it, but
i don't want to be
rude.

it seems like good
poetry but i can't
read right now and
i don't want to be
rude so i just sit
and think.

the aesthetics of
good poetry elude me.

i wonder if poets
have editors?

i write anything, and
my first thought is always
to ask for feedback.

maybe it's not like that.
maybe poetry is more than
weird line breaks and bad formatting.
maybe it's less.
maybe i need to stop editing, and write.

every year i get
my flu shot, and
it's always like

i say something,
a bit self-aware
about my fear, &

the person (they
might be doctors
i wouldn't know)

just assures me,
says "it doesn't
hurt!" like that

would be news to
me, but i always
say that first &

i think maybe it
is just the only
response they've

ever learned? it
never helps, but
i don't care b/c

it still happens
but sometimes, i
wonder, if shots

wouldn't help? i
think maybe more
flu shots could,

in theory, teach
me that they're fine.

this is an analogy by the way, but it's all still true.
i just have a lot of the same problems over and over again.

sometimes i think
about letting the
people i love see
the poems i make.

but then usually,
i ask myself if i
even write poems,
on account of the
nonstandard meter
that i write with

like really, what
in the sam-hell's
all this?

illegitimate, probably.

but maybe there's
no valid sense of
legitimacy for me
to police my self
expression with &
maybe that's even
worse than writing bad poetry.
