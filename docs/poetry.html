airpods in my ears
i press on them to
try to get them to
fit just right, so
that i wont hear a
thing.

but i hear them, &
they're talking, &
i can't fucking read.

his elbow is on my
desk and i know it
doesn't matter and
if i asked him, he
would move it, but
i don't want to be
rude.

it seems like good
poetry but i can't
read right now and
i don't want to be
rude so i just sit
and think.

the aesthetics of
good poetry elude me.

i wonder if poets
have editors?

i write anything, and
my first thought is always
to ask for feedback.

maybe it's not like that.
maybe poetry is more than
weird line breaks and bad formatting.
maybe it's less.
maybe i need to stop editing, and write.

every year i get
my flu shot, and
it's always like

i say something,
a bit self-aware
about my fear, &

the person (they
might be doctors
i wouldn't know)

just assures me,
says "it doesn't
hurt!" like that

would be news to
me, but i always
say that first &

i think maybe it
is just the only
response they've

ever learned? it
never helps, but
i don't care b/c

it still happens
but sometimes, i
wonder, if shots

wouldn't help? i
think maybe more
flu shots could,

in theory, teach
me that they're fine.

this is an analogy by the way, but it's all still true.
i just have a lot of the same problems over and over again.

sometimes i think
about letting the
people i love see
the poems i make.

but then usually,
i ask myself if i
even write poems,
on account of the
nonstandard meter
that i write with

like really, what
in the sam-hell's
all this?

illegitimate, probably.

but maybe there's
no valid sense of
legitimacy for me
to police my self
expression with &
maybe that's even
worse than writing bad poetry.

And isn't there something really kind of funny,
when the "hero" dies?
because a hero doesnt
die, or because there
isn't a hero there or
because of some other
reason?

And isn't it all kind of ironic,
when i can't even cry
about it? because the
tragedy isn't there &
i'm all right but i'm
not even sure what it
meant, and i think it
all should worry me a
whole lot.

And isn't there something wrong with me,
when i cant even tell
if there's something?
i'm not right, but is
that my fault? should
i be?

And am I not blameless at heart,
when the world around
me is perverse beyond
belief & nobody knows
quite why or where or
even if it's not just
exactly how it should
be?

And does any of it matter,
when children, ripped
from loving arms, are
dying? are my tears a
waste of water or can
i even care about the
answer?

Sometimes I wonder if, by some fault solely my own,
I have made some essential part of my life tragic.

Sometimes I think life was always meant to be this way.

Sometimes, I'm not sure if I should care.

Sometimes, I'm glad I don't have more resolve.

Right now, I just want to be somebody else.
Somewhere else.
